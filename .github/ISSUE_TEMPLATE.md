  Hi! DON'T PANIC
  Please read and fill out the following sections. Just follow the instructions.
  This template will help to solve your issue much quicker.
  Creating good Issues can take a while!

  NOTE: This is not a place to ask general questions about React, React Native,
  React Navigation or JavaScript. Only questions which are caused by poor
  documentation will be answered.
  If you have a question because you're not really experienced in those topics
  or even in development in general: stackoverflow.com is a great place to ask things.

  First step: Use a short but precise title for this issue.

### What kind of Issue is this?

<!-- Answer by changing [ ] to [x] -->

- [ ] Bug Report
- [ ] Question / Problem
- [ ] Discussion / Feature Request

<!--
  If you've chosen "Discussion / Feature Request", you may delete everything from here on

### How are you using the Bottom Navigation?

<!--
  If you're using it with react-navigation, please check if your issue is
  really related to the Bottom Navigation and not to react-navigation itself.

  You can check this by changing the `tabBarComponent` from this Bottom Navigation
  to react-navigation's TabBar: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/tab

  Is your Issue still appearing, although you're not using the Material Bottom
  Navigation anymore? Then your Issue is likely to be an Issue in react-navigation,
  and thus doesn't belong here.
-->

- [ ] I use it with react-navigation.  
I switched to react-navigation's TabBar and the Issue disappeared, so I think it's related to react-native-material-bottom-navigation.
- [ ] I use the standalone version.

Related Libraries: (If you use the standalone version together with another library, please list them here. If not, delete this line.)


### Expected behavior

(Write what you thought your code should do. Add code snippets later.)


### Actual behavior

(Write what is actually happening. Add code snippets later.)


### Additional description and resources

(Here you can write down everything else you want to say. Maybe you have an idea why your problem is happening?)

(Place a reproducible example here.  
The best thing you can do is to provide a minimal example which reproduces your Issue in Expo's Snack: https://snack.expo.io  
Otherwise: Add Code Snippets here. Add screenshots/gifs showing your issue in action.)
