  Hi! â€“ DON'T PANIC
  Please read the instructions in this template carefully and fill out the
  following sections. This way your issue can be solved much quicker.

  Creating a good Issue generally takes some time.

  NOTE: This is not a place to ask general questions about React, React Native,
  React Navigation or JavaScript. Only questions which are caused by poor
  documentation will be answered.
  If you have a question because you're not really experienced in those topics
  or even in development in general: stackoverflow.com is a great place for questions.

  Don't forget to add a short but descriptive title for this issue.

### How are you using the Bottom Navigation?

<!--
  If you're using the Bottom Navigation together with react-navigation, be sure
  that your issue is related to the Bottom Navigation and not to react-navigation itself.

  You can check this by changing the `tabBarComponent` from this Bottom Navigation
  to react-navigation's TabBar: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/tab

  Is your Issue still appearing, although you're not using the Bottom Navigation
  anymore? Then your Issue is likely to be an Issue with react-navigation,
  and thus doesn't belong here.
-->

- [ ] I use the Bottom Navigation together with react-navigation; the Issue is not appearing when I'm using react-navigation's TabBar instead.
- [ ] I use the standalone version.

Related Libraries: (If you use the standalone version together with other libraries, please list them here. If not, delete this line.)
